// Delayed Messages for Program Automation

// The gstd::msg::send_delayed function allows sending a message after a specified delay. The function takes the following parameters:

// program - the program (or user) to which the message will be sent
// payload - the payload of the message
// value - the amount of tokens to be sent with the message
// delay - the delay in blocks after which the message will be sent

// Gear Protocol enables the message processing to be paid with reserved gas by using the gstd::msg::send_delayed_from_reservation function, which takes a reservation ID as the first parameter.
